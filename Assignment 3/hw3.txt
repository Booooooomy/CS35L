Q1. The patch made the performance of ls worse. This is due to the fact that
    an additional check was added in the code of command to ignore "." and ".."
    that worsens performance. The time command affirms with this. Both commands
    were tested on various directories and the unmodified command was done
    in a faster time than the unmodified command almost every attempt.

Q2. The new version of coreutils should not introduce any problems in our
    application as long as our code follows the POSIX.1-2008 standards. We just
    need to be aware of situations where we may have put the -A flag after -f
    and expected "." and ".." to be included as well.

Q3. The script runs into an error when it's invoked on an empty file with a
    numlines parameter that is greater than 0. Since the file is empty, an
    IndexError is thrown in the chooseline() function. The error does not occur
    when we pass 0 into numlines but this does not access the function and
    essentially does nothing.
The output:
File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
  main()
File "randline.py", line 64, in main
  sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
  return random.choice(self.lines)
File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.14/lib/python2.7/random.py", line 277, in choice
  return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range


Q4. When the script is invoked with Python 3, it does not work in any case and
    outputs a SyntaxError. Python 3 deprecated automatic tuple unpacking so the
    (errno, strerror) passed in as an exception gives an error.
The output:
File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
